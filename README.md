# Full Stack AI Engineer Technical Assessment: Intelligent Product Support System

## The Challenge

Your company's product support team is drowning in tickets. With 100,000+ historical tickets and 500+ new ones daily, they need an intelligent system that can learn from past resolutions to automatically handle routine issues, surface emerging problems, and help agents resolve complex cases faster.

## Your Mission

Build an end-to-end intelligent support system that:

1. **Understands** incoming support tickets (categorization, priority, sentiment)
2. **Retrieves** relevant solutions from past resolutions and documentation
3. **Detects** emerging issues and anomalies in real-time
4. **Learns** from agent actions and customer feedback


## Important Notes

### Freedom of Choice
- Use any programming languages, frameworks, or cloud services you prefer
- Choose appropriate MLOps tools and practices that align with industry standards
- You can simulate external services if needed
- Focus on demonstrating your approach rather than perfect implementation of every feature

### What We're Looking For
- **System thinking**: How components work together
- **Practical choices**: Real-world trade-offs and constraints
- **Production mindset**: Building for reliability, reproducibility, and scale
- **Engineering excellence**: Clean, maintainable code with proper dependency management
- **Clear communication**: Well-documented decisions and code

## Technical Requirements

### The System You'll Build

Create a unified AI system that processes support tickets through multiple intelligent components working together. Your implementation should include:

**Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering**
- Ingest ticket data from provided JSON files
- Build a feature store that serves both real-time and batch features
- Create analytical models for business metrics (resolution times, satisfaction drivers, agent performance)
- Implement data quality checks and monitoring
- Design event schemas for tracking all system interactions

**Intelligent Processing Engine (Components should build on each other)**

1. **Multi-Model Categorization** (Foundation Layer)
   - Implement both traditional ML (XGBoost/CatBoost) and deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras) approaches for ticket classification
   - Compare their performance/latency trade-offs
   - Target >85% weighted F1 score
   - Output categories feed into the retrieval system

2. **RAG + Graph-RAG Solution Finder** (Uses categorization output)
   - Build a hybrid retrieval system that uses the predicted categories to improve search
   - Combines semantic search with keyword matching and metadata filtering
   - Maps relationships: Products ↔ Issues ↔ Solutions ↔ Historical Tickets
   - Links entities (error codes, product names, technical terms)
   - Re-ranks results based on resolution success rates and category relevance

3. **Anomaly Detection** (Analyzes patterns from both above components)
   - Create an analyzer that monitors categorization patterns and retrieval failures to identify:
     - Unusual ticket volume patterns per category
     - New issue types not matching existing categories
     - Sentiment shifts in specific product areas
     - Emerging problems based on retrieval system query patterns

**System Enhancements**
- Implement proper model versioning and experiment tracking using industry-standard MLOps practices
- Ensure reproducible model training and deployment through appropriate tooling
- Design for containerized deployment to ensure consistency across environments
- Performance monitoring and drift detection  
- Fallback mechanisms for system failures
- Capture agent corrections and customer feedback
- Update models based on resolution success/failure
- Automated quality scoring for generated responses

## Provided Resources

### Dataset
You will receive a single JSON file containing 100,000 historical support tickets. You should:
- Split this into training, validation, and test sets (suggested: 70/15/15 split)
- Use appropriate techniques to handle class imbalance
- Document your data splitting strategy and rationale
- Consider how your system would handle streaming data in production

## 🐳 Containerized Deployment (Docker)

To ensure consistency across environments, you can build and run this project using Docker. This encapsulates all dependencies and environment settings, so it will work the same way everywhere.

### 1. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t support-system .
```

### 2. Run the Container

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 support-system
```

- The API will be available at http://localhost:8000
- The container uses the `requirements.txt` for dependencies and starts the FastAPI server by default.

### 3. (Optional) Run MLflow UI in Docker

If you want to run the MLflow UI in a container as well:

```bash
docker run -p 5050:5000 -v $(pwd)/mlruns:/app/mlruns --entrypoint mlflow support-system ui --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
```

- This will expose the MLflow UI at http://localhost:5050 and mount your experiment logs.
