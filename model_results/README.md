# Model Results

This folder is intended to store all model performance outputs, including:
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, etc.)
- Visualizations (confusion matrices, ROC curves, loss/accuracy plots, etc.)
- Model comparison graphs
- Any other artifacts related to model performance tracking

## Usage
- Save all plots and result files generated during model training and evaluation here.
- Organize by experiment, date, or model type as needed.

Example structure:
- model_results/
    - xgboost/
    - keras/
    - comparison/
    - metrics_summary.csv
    - confusion_matrix_xgboost.png
    - roc_curve_keras.png
